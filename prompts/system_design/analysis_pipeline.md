# Forensic Analysis Pipeline

This document describes the multi-layered reasoning pipeline used by the Multimodal Forensic AI Engine.

## Pipeline Stages
1. Content DNA extraction from video frames and audio
2. Temporal consistency analysis across frames
3. Physiological realism validation
4. Audio-visual synchronization verification
5. Model attribution and manipulation lineage inference
6. Intent and harm assessment
7. Legal-grade evidence structuring

Each stage produces explainable signals used in the final verdict.
